We work with MSeq data discussed in the main preprint for `CNAqc`, replicating one analysis for patient `Set06`.

The data we used is hosted at the GitHub repository [caravagnalab/CNAqc_datasets](https://github.com/caravagnalab/CNAqc_datasets).

# Mutation data

We download from Github a VCF file for MSeq sample `Set06`, and load it using the `vcfR` package.

```{r}
VCF_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caravagnalab/CNAqc_datasets/main/MSeq_Set06/Mutations/Set.06.WGS.merged_filtered.vcf"

# Download, load and cancel data
download.file(VCF_url, "Set.06.WGS.merged_filtered.vcf",)

set6 = vcfR::read.vcfR("Set.06.WGS.merged_filtered.vcf")

file.remove("Set.06.WGS.merged_filtered.vcf")

# VCF
print(set6)
```

We extract all the information we need, using the tidy data representation format.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# INFO fields 
info_tidy = vcfR::extract_info_tidy(set6)

# Fixed fields (genomic coordinates)
fix_tidy = set6@fix %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  rename(
    chr = CHROM,
    from = POS,
    ref = REF,
    alt = ALT
  ) %>%
  mutate(from = as.numeric(from), to = from + nchar(alt))

# Genotypes
geno_tidy = vcfR::extract_gt_tidy(set6) %>%
  group_split(Indiv)

# Sample mutations in the CNAqc format
sample_mutations = lapply(geno_tidy, function(x) {
  bind_cols(info_tidy, fix_tidy) %>%
    full_join(x, by = "Key") %>%
    mutate(DP = as.numeric(gt_NR), NV = as.numeric(gt_NV)) %>%
    mutate(VAF = NV / DP) %>%
    dplyr::select(chr, from, to, ref, alt, NV, DP, VAF, everything()) %>%
    filter(!is.na(VAF), VAF > 0)
})

# A list for all samples available
names(sample_mutations) = sapply(sample_mutations, function(x) x$Indiv[1])
sample_mutations = sample_mutations[!is.na(names(sample_mutations))]
```


We have all the somatic mutations called for `Set06`.
```{r}
print(sample_mutations)
```

# Copy Number data

Sequenza calls are available in the same repository. 

We use an extra function to load a solution (so we can easily compare multiple runs etc etc.).

```{r}
# Load Sequenza output
load_SQ_output = function(URL, sample, run)
{
  # We can directly read them from remote URLs
  segments_file = paste0(URL, run, '/', sample, '.smoothedSegs.txt')
  purity_file = paste0(URL, run, '/', sample, '_confints_CP.txt')

  # Get segments
  segments = readr::read_tsv(segments_file, col_types = readr::cols()) %>%
    dplyr::rename(
      chr = chromosome,
      from = start.pos,
      to = end.pos,
      Major = A,
      minor = B
    ) %>%
    dplyr::select(chr, from, to, Major, minor, dplyr::everything())

  # Get purity and ploidy
  solutions = readr::read_tsv(purity_file, col_types = readr::cols())

  purity = solutions$cellularity[2]
  ploidy = solutions$ploidy.estimate[2]
  
  return(
    list(
      segments = segments,
      purity = purity,
      ploidy = ploidy
    )
  )
}

```

We can load the calls for 2 solutions of sample `Set6_42`; we begin with our final, good solution.

```{r}
Sequenza_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caravagnalab/CNAqc_datasets/main/MSeq_Set06/Copy%20Number/"

# Final sequenza run (good calls)
Sequenza_good_calls = load_SQ_output(Sequenza_URL, sample = 'Set6_42', run = 'final')

print(Sequenza_good_calls)
```

# Calls analysis

For this example we work with mutations found in sample `Set6_42`.

```{r}
# Single-nucleotide variants with VAF >5%
snvs = sample_mutations[['Set6_42']] %>% 
    filter(ref %in% c('A', 'C', "T", 'G'), alt %in% c('A', 'C', "T", 'G')) %>%
    filter(VAF > 0.05)

# CNA segments and purity
cna = Sequenza_good_calls$segments
purity = Sequenza_good_calls$purity
```

Full CNAqc analysis. First we create the object.

```{r}
# CNAqc data object
x = CNAqc::init(
  mutations = snvs,
  cna = cna,
  purity = purity,
  ref = "GRCh38")

print(x)
```

## Data 

Show the CNA data for this sample.

```{r, fig.width=9.5, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_gw_counts(x),
  plot_gw_vaf(x, N = 10000),
  plot_gw_depth(x, N = 10000),
  plot_segments(x, highlight = c("1:0", "1:1", "2:0", "2:1", '2:2')),
  align = 'v', 
  nrow = 4, 
  rel_heights = c(.15, .15, .15, .8))
```

Show the mutation data for this sample.

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=3}
ggpubr::ggarrange(
  plot_data_histogram(x, which = 'VAF'),
  plot_data_histogram(x, which = 'DP'),
  plot_data_histogram(x, which = 'NV'),
  ncol = 3,
  nrow = 1
  )
``` 


## Peak detection 

Perform peak detection and show its results. 
```{r}
# Peaks
x = CNAqc::analyze_peaks(x, matching_strategy = 'closest')

print(x)
```

For this sample these calls are passed by CNAqc.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, warning=F}
# Do not assemble plots, and remove karyotypes with no data associated
plot_peaks_analysis(x, empty_plot = FALSE, assembly_plot = FALSE)
```

## CCF 

Perform CCF computation detection with the `ENTROPY` method.
```{r}
# CCF
x = CNAqc::compute_CCF(x, method = 'ENTROPY')

print(x)
```

CCF can be estimated well for this sample.

```{r,fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3.5,warning=F}
# Do not assemble plots, and remove karyotypes with no data associated
plot_CCF(x, assembly_plot = FALSE, empty_plot = FALSE)
```

## Other analyses 

Smooth segments with gaps up to 10 megabases (does not affect segments in this sample).

```{r}
x = CNAqc::smooth_segments(x)

print(x)
```

Perform fragmentation analysis (no excess of short segments in this sample).

```{r}
x = CNAqc::detect_arm_overfragmentation(x)

print(x)
```


# Alternative solutions

We show how to discover that a tetraploid solution is not correct.

```{r}
# Tetraploid solution sequenza  (bad calls)
Sequenza_bad_calls = load_SQ_output(Sequenza_URL, sample = 'Set6_42', run = 'tetra')

# CNA segments and purity
cna = Sequenza_bad_calls$segments
purity = Sequenza_bad_calls$purity

print(Sequenza_bad_calls$ploidy) # Tetraploid
```

Let's see why this is wrong, using peak detection.

```{r}
# CNAqc data object
x = CNAqc::init(
  mutations = snvs,
  cna = cna,
  purity = purity,
  ref = "GRCh38") %>% 
  CNAqc::analyze_peaks(matching_strategy = 'closest')

print(x)
```

For this sample these calls are flagged by CNAqc; note that most of the mutations are mapped to tetraploid segments, but one of the two peaks is completely off. Note the overall coloring is green because most of the mutations are underneath a peak that is passed by CNAqc; however the overall karyotype can be failed because it does not show the expected 2-peaks VAF spectrum for tetraploid SNVs.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, warning=F}
# Do not assemble plots, and remove karyotypes with no data associated
plot_peaks_analysis(x, empty_plot = FALSE, assembly_plot = FALSE)
```

We do the same for a low-cellularity one.

```{r}
# Low cellularity solution sequenza  (bad calls)
Sequenza_bad_calls = load_SQ_output(Sequenza_URL, sample = 'Set6_42', run = 'lowcell')

# CNA segments and purity
cna = Sequenza_bad_calls$segments
purity = Sequenza_bad_calls$purity

# CNAqc data object
x = CNAqc::init(
  mutations = snvs,
  cna = cna,
  purity = purity,
  ref = "GRCh38") %>% 
  CNAqc::analyze_peaks(matching_strategy = 'closest')

print(x)
```

For this sample these calls are flagged by CNAqc because the purity is off by a `~10%` factor.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3.5, warning=F}
plot_peaks_analysis(x, empty_plot = FALSE, assembly_plot = FALSE)
```

CNAqc can help increasing the caller purity in this case; the expected adjustment (score from VAF analysis) of 5% would correspond indeed to a purity increase of `10%`.
 
```{r} 
print(Sequenza_bad_calls$purity - Sequenza_good_calls$purity) # error in these calls

#CNAqc suggested adjustment
x$peaks_analysis$score
```
