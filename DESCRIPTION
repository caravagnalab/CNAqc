Description: CNAqc is a package to provide a set of metrics to assess the quality of 
  Copy Number Alteration (CNA) calls, somatic mutations and other tumour covariates from bulk sequencing. 
  The package provides statistical measures to quantify the concordance 
  between mutation and CNAs, exploiting allelic imbalance in allele-specific CNA segments and allelic 
  frequencies of somatic mutations. Quantitative metrics and plots for data exploration and quality control 
  are available, allowing for an intuitive assessment of the quality of calls. Quantitative measures can 
  also be used to suggest adjustments of the current purity estimates to increase the quality of CNA calls.
  The tools is general and can be applied downstream of any bioinformatics pipeline.
  Routines to determine Cancer Cell Franctions for each mutation are available as well. CNAqc is part of the
  evoverse, a package that gathers multiple R packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
